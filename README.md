# Happy Hour Phase 1 Project

## What do I want a user to see when they first load the page?

- header with app name
- search bar to search by cocktail name
- feeling lucky button

## How do we want a user to be able to interact with our web application?

### What are the user stories? (keep in mind we need 3 unique eventListeners)

### Minimum Viable Product Deliverables (core)

1. when a user SUBMITs the search form, display search results

2. when a user HOVERs on the header with the app name it changes color

3. when a user CLICKs on the feeling lucky button show them a random cocktail

### Stretch Deliverables

1. a user can click a favorite button when cocktails are displayed and save cocktail as favorite to db.json (POST+)

2. a user can view a list of all their favorite cocktails

3. a user can click an unfavorite button and remove cocktails from favorite list (DELETE)
